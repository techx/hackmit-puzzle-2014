Following that, I was invited for an MIT Research Science Institute (RSI) fellowship where I continued to develop intuitive 3D bioinformatics visualization applications for iOS and Android. At HackMIT, I want to be able to learn about how mobile platforms can be used to make a tangible difference in the social condition of the human race. Whether through avenues such as new mobile medical device design or data analytics for augmenting our reality, I feel that mobile technologies can have a profound impact aside from use purely as social media interfaces. At HackMIT, I hope to be exposed to some of these possibilities.'
