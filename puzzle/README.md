## HackMIT Registration Puzzle

This is a super sneaky fun puzzle to let the best hackers register for HackMIT 2014. It is based on the theme of cats taking over the world with cute cat gifs. More instructions on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r5J0rAwJqZXpRHyzi_nYrrKyzY6yONV6CVfZ0K8cetY/edit).

### Instructions on how to set up the puzzle:
There are 5 parts to the puzzle. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Static spoof page with Nyan Cat. Just put on any web server.
2. [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) set up at 224-900-2583 that reads out a fun poem. Just throw the XML and assosiated MP3 files on a web server, and change the Twilio control panel to point at the XML file.
3. QR code was generated by an online tool, then spliced into 25 pieces by [Posterazor](http://posterazor.sourceforge.net/).
4. This puzzle is a simple Flask app, ready to run on Heroku. Just create a new Heroku instance and push:
`heroku create` then `git init` then `git push heroku master`

   To test locally, run `python manage.py runserver` and browse to `http://localhost:5000`

5. FancyCat Club is a bit more nuanced than a simple Flask app. It's database driven (MongoDB). Here's how I set it up on DigitalOcean:

    a. Setup initial user accounts, etc
    
    b. Install Apache2, MongoDB, Python, requirements.txt
    
    c. Install Apache2 WSGI
    
    d. Create WSGI app
    
    e. Reload configs, populate DB with `python manage.py shell < /path/to/populate_db.py` (run inside `catgif` directory)
    
    Currently, to change configurations, log into our server with `ssh catgif@107.170.159.99 -p 2014`. Your public key must be added in order to login.
