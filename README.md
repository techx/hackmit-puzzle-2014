Welcome to the HackMIT-Specific Repo!
==========
Ground rules
-----------
1. Always develop on a feature branch (name appropriately) and submit pull requests to develop when you're ready to pull your code in.
2. Test thoroughly! Aim for full coverage of code paths and user behaviors; ask team members for testing support. Always test before you push.
3. Ditto for including documentation, configuration templates, and updating READMEs, make or install files, and the .gitignore.
4. Even though this is the hackmit-specific repo, don't push secret keys or non-public information of any kind. Put those into separate config files that aren't committed or pushed (use the .gitignore to cover yourself!)
5. Before committing or pushing ask yourself...
    - Did I add all the files I meant to? (git status)
    - Do I have a clear-cut message on what I am committing?
    - Am I on the right branch?
